            <h2>Coming to Refuge:</h2>

            <p>When you come to Refuge for the first time, you will be met with a support worker, who will listen and
                support you through admission to the Refuge. We know that it is not easy to have to leave your home and
                seek
                the support of the Refuge and we endeavour to make you as welcome and comfortable as possible while
                supporting you through this difficult time.
                Our aim is to help you as a woman, to work towards your own goals and we know that you may need time to
                reflect, and to think about your plans while remaining safe in Refuge.<br><br> We believe that all
                people,
                regardless of age, race, class, education, religion or sexual orientation have the right to a
                non-violent
                life.
                We also recognise that sometimes, that your sole need from our service maybe a period of respite and we
                respect your wishes in this.
                We offer six self-contained apartments which include your own kitchen/living room, bedroom and your own
                bathroom. <br><br>All our apartments are fully fitted with the necessary appliances needed for everyday
                living.
                If you do not have money on arrival, staff will support you in accessing financial support and we will
                ensure that neither you, or your children will go without while waiting for an income to be set up.
                If you do not have clothes, shoes or other basic necessities, we will also ensure that you will be
                looked
                after from our provisions. <br><br>The Refuge is very well supported by the community and we receive
                regular support
                by donations of clothes, toiletries, etc.

                When in Refuge, you will have a Support Worker available to sit, listen and support you. We, recognise
                that
                you have your own unique needs and wishes and we will try to support and facilitate your needs as best
                we
                can during your stay with us.

                We provide a range of information on finance, housing, children, court orders and social welfare.</p>

            <h2>ChildCare</h2>

            <p>In Refuge, we have a playroom which is available to you and your children during your stay. We appreciate
                that it is not only difficult for you but also your children to transition into life in Refuge.
                <br><br>We have
                a
                dedicated Child Care worker who will support both you and your children around this, often confusing and
                emotional time. We have a playroom with many different activities and toys to help the children to
                settle in
                and entertain them during the day.

                We also support family members, friends and professionals who have concerns about a person, who might be
                experience domestic abuse.
                We hope to empower women to better understand what may be happening for them and offer information and
                advocacy to gain a better understanding as to the options that may be available to them. <br> <br>
                Our role is to believe and offer support around your situation, we understand the dynamics and impact of

                We appreciate how difficult it can be to pick up the phone and tell someone about what is happening. We
                will

                in
                sharing.<br> <br>
                Talking about your experiences with us, may give you the opportunity to share with someone the
                difficulties
                and hardships faced in an abusive relationship.

            <h2>Outreach Support</h2>

            <p>Some women may not need or want to come to a refuge but still require information and support. If this is
                how you feel, you might like to talk to our Outreach Support Workers who are there to help you. An
                outreach
                support worker can drive to meet you so that you both can sit down and talk about your situation.
                <br><br>You may
                not feel ready to do anything but it can give you the opportunity to talk and have someone listen to you
                in
                a supportive and confidential way. The outreach support worker can work with you if you need information
                on
                welfare entitlements, alternative accommodation, legal advice, education and training etc.</p>

            <h3>This service is free of charge</h3>

            <br>
            <p>This is available to women Monday to Friday in County Kerry.
                The Outreach service can be accessed by contacting the Refuge on: <h3>066 712 9100</h3> and arranging an
                appointment with an Outreach Worker.<br><br>

            <h2>Helping a friend or a family member</h2>


            <p>Helping a friend or a family member if they're experiencing domestic abuse.<br><br>
                If you're worried a friend is being abused, let them know you've noticed something is wrong.
                They might not be ready to talk but try to find quiet times when they can talk if they choose to.
                If someone confides in you that they're suffering domestic abuse:<br><br>
                <uL>
                    <li>listen, and take care not to blame them</li>
                    <li>acknowledge it takes strength to talk to someone about experiencing abuse</li>
                    <li>give them time to talk, but don't push them to talk if they don't want to</li>
                    <li>acknowledge they're in a frightening and difficult situation</li>
                    <li>tell them nobody deserves to be threatened or beaten, despite what the abuser has said</li>
                    <li>support them as a friend – encourage them to express their feelings, and allow them to make
                        their own decisions</li>
                    <li>don't tell them to leave the relationship if they're not ready – that's their decision</li>
                    <li>ask if they have suffered physical harm – if so, offer to go with them to a hospital or GP</li>
                    <li>help them report the assault to the Gardai they choose to</li>
                    <li>Be ready to give them ADAPT’s contact details so they can access, free, confidential support
                    </li>
